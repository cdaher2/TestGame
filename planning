Basic plan:
-launch program
-player controls sprite
-player is able to walk through the stage and win the stage
-everything else static, panning camera

how things are going to work:
-floor will be a series of rectangles, input will be a text file with a series of numbers specifying how high they are
-camera will pan by moving everything except the player
